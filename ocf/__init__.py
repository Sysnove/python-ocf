**python-ocf: Open Clustering Framework Resource Agent API for Python**

This particular module mostly serves as a repository for constants used
extensively during OCF RA development, and contains short-cuts for accessing
the most important elements from sub-modules of this ``ocf`` package.

.. seealso::

   `The OCF Resource Agent Developer's Guide, Return codes`
      <http://www.linux-ha.org/doc/dev-guides/_return_codes.html>

In addition to the members declared below, the following aliases are available:

.. py:class:: ocf.ResourceAgent

   Alias for :class:`ocf.ra.ResourceAgent`.

.. py:class:: ocf.Parameter

   Alias for :class:`ocf.ra.Parameter`.

.. py:class:: ocf.Action

   Alias for :class:`ocf.ra.Action`.

# OCF does not include the concept of master/slave resources so pacemaker needs
# to extend it so it can discover a resource's complete state.

# OCF_RUNNING_MASTER:
#    The resource is in "master" mode and fully operational
# OCF_FAILED_MASTER:
#    The resource is in "master" mode but in a failed state
#
# The extra two values should only be used during a probe.
#
# Probes are used to discover resources that were started outside of the CRM
# and/or left behind if the LRM fails. They can be identified in RA scripts by
# checking ocf.env.is_probe().
#
# Failed "slaves" should continue to use: OCF_ERR_GENERIC.
# Fully operational "slaves" should continue to use: OCF_SUCCESS.
